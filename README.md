Hello everyone.  
This is Elyar. I am a PhD student at the University of Regina working under the supervision of Professor Mehrandezh.

My Machine Vision course was a good reason to create this repo with its binder to use the power of binder and git to demonstrate the class assignments in an interactive way. You can use the button at the top to build the docker image of this repo and see what is going on here.

Best,  
Elyar
